### Hi there I am Ken Xu ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior College Student studying Computer Science Game at USC. I have been playing games since the age of 5 and love every aspect of them. I think there is nothing more beautiful and satisfying than to see so many elements - music, 
scenery, dialog - all come together to make memories players will not forget. I am especially interested Gameplay design and engineering, as I have worked on several video games as a Gameplay engineer.
